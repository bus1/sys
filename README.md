# Osi/Sys - Capability-based System Interfaces

This is the home of the `osi` and `sys` Rust packages. They provide access to
a wide collection of system-independent, as well as system-specific, interfaces
following a capability-based design. The `osi` package provides portable
interfaces (operating system independent), while the `sys` package provides
system specific interfaces.
